### Use subheadings to organize your codelab

Start each section by explaining what the next chunk of code will do. Follow it with your code.

Use triple backticks to start and end a fenced code block. Use `js` to set the language for syntax highlighting.

```js
function sampleCode() {
  console.log('This is just sample javascript');
}
```

### Show expected results

Show the developer the expected result of running their code.  You can point to images in the `assets` directory, as in the example below.

![A console log from running the sample code](assets/TEMPLATE-CODELAB-ID/run_sample_code.png)

Put your assets in a subfolder with your codelab's ID as the folder name.
